<p>I've written in the past about our challenges with rural broadband (<a href="/blog/rural-internet1.html">here</a> and <a href="/blog/rural-internet2.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>Our farm is in unincorporated rural Johnson County Missouri about 30 miles east of the Kansas City metro.</p>

<p>I work from home so good internet is a necessity.</p>

<p>Up until early 2023 we got by with a combination of several cellular connections and Viasat for latency insensitive uses.</p>

<p>And Elon Musk's Starlink still isn't available here as of June 2023.</p>

<p>But earlier this year, thanks to the Biden administration and the <a href="https://rdof.com">Rural Digital Opportunity Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.spectrum.net">Spectrum</a> built a modern fiber-optic backbone in our area.</p>

<p>I signed up and we got hooked up the week after the fiber backhaul along the road in front of the farm was installed.</p>

<p>We got fiber-to-the-house with 1-Gbps symmetric. It's amazing.</p>
