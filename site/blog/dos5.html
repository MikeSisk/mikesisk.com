<hr>

<p>My first job in technology was at Autodesk in AutoCAD Product Support at 
the old office in Sausalito on 2330 Marinship Way. 

<p>At the time AutoCAD support was only though authorized dealers (or direct
to the customer only on CompuServe). Most of the dealers were pretty good
a figuring things out so we mostly only got really interesting support
questions on the phone line. 

<p>When Microsoft introduced MS-DOS 5.0 in June 1991 our support lines blew 
up with dealers asking how our products will work with the new support for
memory over 640KB.

<p>In response I wrote this <a href="misc/autodesk/dos5.txt">letter</a> that 
we could send to dealers and post on our CompuServe forum. And by coincidence 
I wrote this letter exactly 32 years ago from this posting date. 

<p>How time flies!
