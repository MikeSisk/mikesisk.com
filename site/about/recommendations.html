 <h1>Recommendations</h1>
 
<p><i>Mike was early into the internet when innovators did it all. His general knowledge and administrative competence kept AboutUs.org up with 20 million pages in an unusual entrepreneurial Mediawiki configuration. We've stayed in touch. I'm not surprised to find him always working on the frontier of networked computing and the applications that this enables.</i></p>

<p> — <b>Ward Cunningham</b>, inventor of wiki, past CTO, AboutUs.org</p>

<p><i>Mike and I have worked together on a bunch of Unix- and Oracle-backed Internet applications. I don't know anything about maintaining Unix or Oracle, so his knowledge and skill was critical to getting anything accomplished. Mike is very responsive and understands that programmers might get stuck at 11 pm and that there is a lot of value in getting them unstuck so that they can keep working overnight.</p>

<p>I recommended a lot of customers to Mike and all were satisfied with his work in building and maintaining medium-volume commercial Web sites. In a 24/7 business if your customers still like you, you are doing something right.</i></p>

<p> — <b>Dr. Philip Greenspun</b>, MIT</p>

<p><i>Mike came to us at a period of rapid growth and significant platform infrastructure changes at G5. As the only operations engineer on staff he handled the many tasks we threw at him with professionalism and grace. He maintained a great sense of calm in sometimes stormy waters, and worked tirelessly to help improve the many operational challenges that our organization faced.</i></p>

<p> — <b>Chris Kraybill</b>, past CTO, getg5.com</p>

<p><i>When I was trying to launch my dot-com (tightcircle.com) it became necessary to move to a more stable, professionally maintained system. For a brief while, during our best-funded months, Furfly assisted us with this effort.</p>

<p>Mike's knowledge of Red Hat Linux and Oracle's interaction with it was phenomenal. Seemingly arcane details of implementation appeared to be things he dealt with several times a day.</p>

<p>He was very aware of what a 'production' machine was and there was never a time that his work caused any down time. (My own mistakes often caused crises that he solved as soon as I realized that I had poured gas on the fire. Again.) His calm voice at the other end of the phone or email line kept me from panicking on more than one occasion.</i></p>

<p> — <b>Colin Summers</b>, Architect, inventor, web developer, pilot</p>

<p><i>Furfly saved our ass on the Planet project.</p>

<p>Furfly rescued a two year development project from certain failure for Greenpeace. We'd made a bad choice in selecting our initial partners to develop a network of worldwide community websites, Greenpeace Planet.  What we got was cut-and-paste code which not only failed to take advantage of the strengths of ACS, but didn't conform to the basic standards of documentation and functionality we'd asked for. It was ugly. It was broken. Our technical lead knew we had a problem, and that we needed a skilled surgeon.  He flew to Portland to talk to Don Baccus and Furfly. Suddenly, we were in daily contact with the code team.  We had intelligent questions. We had elegant answers. We saw thousands of lines of code reduced to simple, well documented, artfully crafted procedures of a few statements. To top it all off, Don came to Amsterdam to ensure a smooth launch. We launched on time, on budget, and with a stable system to roars of applause. Thanks, Furfly!</i></p>
